# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, so undersampling was used to balance fraud and normal transactions.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Total Transactions: 284,807
- Fraud Cases: 492
- Features: 30 anonymized features (V1–V28, Time, Amount)

Dataset source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
